ised is a versatile command-line tool designed for generating number
sequences and performing arithmetic evaluations. Unlike large GUI-based
mathematical software, ised is specifically tailored for efficient use
within shell scripting environments, complementing GNU core utilities.

Its primary advantage lies in its ability to generalize all functions
to operate on one-dimensional arrays, making it highly flexible for
various tasks:

-   **Sequence Generation**: Functions similarly to `seq` for creating
    numerical sequences, useful for loop indexing.
-   **File Processing**: Enables line-by-line arithmetic processing of
    data files.
-   **Floating-Point Math**: Provides robust floating-point arithmetic
    capabilities for shells that lack native support.
-   **Interactive Calculator**: Can be used interactively as an extended
    calculator for quick computations.

ised is an invaluable utility for system administrators, developers,
and researchers who require a lightweight yet powerful tool for numerical
manipulation and scripting in command-line environments.
