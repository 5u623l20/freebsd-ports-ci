BRiAl (Boolean Rings and Algebra) is a powerful C++ library for
computations with polynomials over Boolean rings, serving as the
successor to PolyBoRi. It provides high-level data types and efficient
algorithms for symbolic computation in this specialized algebraic domain.

Key features include:

-   **High-level Data Types**: For Boolean polynomials, monomials,
    exponent vectors, and related algebraic structures.
-   **Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs)**: Utilizes BDDs as the internal
    storage type for polynomial structures, enabling efficient
    representation and manipulation.
-   **Python Interface**: Offers a convenient Python binding, allowing
    for parsing complex polynomial systems and implementing sophisticated
    strategies for Grobner basis computation.
-   **Grobner Basis Computation**: Provides a robust and powerful
    reference implementation for Grobner basis algorithms, essential
    for solving systems of polynomial equations.

BRiAl is an invaluable tool for researchers and developers in areas
such as cryptography, coding theory, formal verification, and computer
algebra, where efficient manipulation of Boolean polynomials is critical.
