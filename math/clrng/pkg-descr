clRNG is a specialized library designed for high-quality uniform random
number generation within OpenCL environments. It provides a robust and
efficient solution for parallel applications requiring statistically
sound random numbers on GPUs and other OpenCL-compatible devices.

The library introduces the concept of "streams of random numbers," which
act as virtual random number generators. These streams can be created
in unlimited quantities on the host system and then utilized by work
items on computing devices to generate random numbers. Each stream also
features equally-spaced substreams, offering additional flexibility for
complex simulations.

clRNG currently implements a selection of well-regarded pseudorandom
number generators, including:

-   MRG31k3p
-   MRG32k3a
-   LFSR113
-   Philox-4x32-10

This library is an invaluable resource for researchers and developers
in fields such as Monte Carlo simulations, scientific computing, and
machine learning, where efficient and reliable parallel random number
generation is crucial.
