fvcore is a lightweight and highly optimized core library designed to
provide essential functionalities shared across various computer vision
frameworks developed at FAIR (Facebook AI Research). It serves as a
foundational toolkit, streamlining the development of advanced vision
models and applications.

This library encapsulates common utilities and building blocks, such as:

-   **Configuration Management**: Tools for handling model configurations.
-   **Logging and Monitoring**: Utilities for tracking experiment progress.
-   **Data Structures**: Efficient data representations for computer
    vision tasks.
-   **Performance Benchmarking**: Integrated tools for evaluating and
    optimizing code performance.

A key strength of fvcore lies in its commitment to quality: all components
are meticulously type-annotated for clarity, thoroughly tested for
reliability, and rigorously benchmarked for optimal performance. It acts
as a crucial dependency for prominent FAIR projects like Detectron2,
PySlowFast, and ClassyVision, enabling developers to build robust and
efficient computer vision systems with confidence.
