libranlip is a C++ library by G. Beliakov for generating random variates
from distributions with arbitrary Lipschitz-continuous densities. It
produces random numbers following smooth probability distributions,
essential for advanced simulations and statistical modeling.

The library uses the efficient acceptance/rejection method for sampling,
effective for densities up to approximately five dimensions. Users provide
their desired density function via a simple syntax.

libranlip is invaluable for researchers and developers in:

-   **Monte Carlo simulations**: For complex systems.
-   **Statistical inference**: Generating samples for Bayesian methods.
-   **Numerical analysis**: Exploring probability distributions.

It offers a flexible and powerful solution for high-fidelity random
number generation in C++ applications.
