mbasecalc is a versatile base calculator, inspired by the original
'basecalc' example from the Xlib Programming Manual by O'Reilly.
It provides a convenient tool for performing arithmetic operations
and conversions across different numerical bases.

Unlike its predecessor, mbasecalc is designed to be cross-platform,
making it accessible and functional on various operating systems
and environments. Users can effortlessly switch between common bases
such as binary, octal, decimal, and hexadecimal, facilitating tasks
involving low-level programming, network protocols, or digital logic.

This utility is particularly useful for developers, students, and
anyone who frequently needs to work with numbers in different bases,
offering a straightforward and efficient solution for base conversions
and calculations.
