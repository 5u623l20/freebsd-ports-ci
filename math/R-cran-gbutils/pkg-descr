The R-cran-gbutils package offers general-purpose utilities for numerical
and statistical computations in R, enhancing flexibility and ease of use.

Key functionalities include:

-   **Distribution Analysis**: Plotting density/distribution functions,
    numerically inverting distributions for quantiles, and simulating
    real/complex numbers from magnitude/argument distributions.
-   **Polynomial Manipulation**: Creating polynomials from roots
    (Cartesian or polar form).
-   **Programming Utilities**: Checking for NA identity, counting
    positional arguments, computing set intersections for multiple sets,
    identifying unnamed arguments, and graphing S4 classes.

This invaluable toolkit streamlines common tasks in data analysis,
statistical modeling, and numerical programming, boosting productivity
and analytical capabilities for R users.
