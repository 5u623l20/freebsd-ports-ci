Concorde is a highly optimized computer code designed for solving the
Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and various related network optimization
problems. Implemented in ANSI C, it is renowned for its ability to find
optimal solutions to extremely large and complex instances of the TSP.

Key features and capabilities include:

-   **Optimal TSP Solutions**: Concorde's TSP solver has successfully
    found optimal solutions for 106 of the 110 TSPLIB instances,
    including problems with up to 15,112 cities.
-   **Extensive Callable Library**: Provides over 700 functions, allowing
    users to develop specialized codes for TSP-like problems and integrate
    Concorde's powerful algorithms into their own applications.
-   **Parallel Computing Support**: All functions are thread-safe for
    shared-memory parallel environments. The main TSP solver also
    supports execution across networks of Unix workstations, enabling
    distributed computation for even larger problems.

Concorde is an invaluable resource for researchers and practitioners
in combinatorial optimization, operations research, and computer science,
offering a robust and efficient solution for one of the most famous
problems in theoretical computer science.
