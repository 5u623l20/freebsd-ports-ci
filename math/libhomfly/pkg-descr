libhomfly is a specialized C library designed to compute the HOMFLY
polynomial of a link. The HOMFLY polynomial is a powerful invariant
in knot theory, used to distinguish different knots and links, providing
crucial information about their topological properties.

This library is a robust conversion of the original program by
Robert J. Jenkins Jr., refactored into a shared library for broader
applicability and ease of integration. It offers a straightforward
interface:

-   **Input**: Accepts a character string formatted identically to the
    input files used by the original standalone program, representing
    the link's structure.
-   **Output**: Returns a string containing the computed HOMFLY polynomial,
    mirroring the output format of the original utility.

libhomfly is an invaluable resource for mathematicians, researchers,
and developers working in knot theory, topology, and related fields.
It provides a reliable and efficient computational engine for analyzing
the complex structures of knots and links, enabling further research
and application development.
