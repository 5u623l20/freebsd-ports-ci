REDUCE Portable Standard Lisp (PSL) is an interactive system for
general algebraic computations. It is designed to assist mathematicians,
scientists, and engineers with symbolic manipulation and numerical tasks.

REDUCE, powered by PSL, is particularly adept at handling complex
calculations that are not feasible to perform by hand. PSL, originally
the implementation of Standard Lisp, has evolved to include numerous
facilities and is optimized for algebraic computation.

Key features and benefits:

-   **General Algebraic Computations**: Performs symbolic manipulation,
    simplification, differentiation, integration, and equation solving.
-   **Efficiency**: Optimized for both space and time, making it efficient
    for algebraic workloads.
-   **Stand-alone System**: PSL provides all necessary support to run
    REDUCE as a self-contained system.
-   **Broad Architecture Support**: Available on many architectures,
    ensuring wide compatibility.

REDUCE-PSL is an invaluable tool for academic and industrial users
requiring a powerful and efficient computer algebra system for research,
development, and problem-solving in various scientific and engineering domains.
