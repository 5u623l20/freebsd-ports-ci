PRNG (Pseudorandom Number Generators) is a robust collection of portable,
high-performance ANSI-C implementations of various pseudorandom number
generators. Developed by Otmar Lendl and Josef Leydold, this library
is designed to provide statistically sound and efficient random number
sequences for a wide range of applications.

The collection includes implementations of:

-   **Linear Congruential Generators (LCG)**: A classic and widely
    understood method for generating pseudorandom numbers.
-   **Inversive Congruential Generators (ICG)**: Offers improved
    statistical properties compared to LCGs, particularly in terms of
    period length and lattice structure.
-   **Explicit Inversive Congruential Generators (EICG)**: Further
    enhances the quality of pseudorandom sequences, often used in
    more demanding simulations.

PRNG is an invaluable resource for researchers, statisticians, and
developers in fields such as Monte Carlo simulations, cryptography,
and scientific modeling, where the quality and performance of random
number generation are critical. Its ANSI-C implementation ensures
broad compatibility and efficient execution across different platforms.
