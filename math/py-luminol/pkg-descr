Luminol is an efficient and lightweight Python library specifically
designed for comprehensive time series data analysis. It provides
powerful functionalities for two critical aspects of time series
investigation: anomaly detection and correlation analysis.

As a lightweight library, Luminol is optimized for performance and
resource efficiency, making it suitable for integration into various
data pipelines and applications without significant overhead.

Its core capabilities include:
-   **Anomaly Detection**: Identifying unusual patterns or outliers in
    time series data that deviate significantly from expected behavior.
    This is crucial for monitoring systems, detecting fraudulent activities,
    or pinpointing performance issues.
-   **Correlation Analysis**: Discovering relationships and dependencies
    between different time series. This feature is particularly useful
    for investigating the root causes of detected anomalies, allowing
    users to understand which factors might be contributing to unusual events.

Luminol empowers data scientists, engineers, and analysts to gain deeper
insights from their time series data, enabling proactive problem-solving
and informed decision-making by effectively pinpointing and diagnosing
anomalous behavior.
