SPBLAS is an ANSI C++ implementation of Chapter 3 of the BLAS (Basic
Linear Algebra Subprograms) Technical Forum Standard. BLAS routines are
fundamental building blocks for high-performance numerical linear algebra,
widely used in scientific computing, engineering, and data analysis.

This library serves as a robust starting point for developing optimized
and architecture-dependent BLAS implementations. Its C++ design offers
several advantages:

-   **Complex Arithmetic Support**: Facilitates computations involving
    complex numbers directly.
-   **Templates**: Enables the creation of various precision codes,
    supporting single, double precision, real, and complex data types.

SPBLAS provides comprehensive coverage of BLAS operations, including:

-   **Level 1**: Vector-vector operations (e.g., dot product, vector scaling).
-   **Level 2**: Matrix-vector operations (e.g., matrix-vector multiplication).
-   **Level 3**: Matrix-matrix operations (e.g., matrix-matrix multiplication),
    which are crucial for many high-performance computing tasks.

This library is an invaluable resource for developers and researchers
who need a portable, standard-compliant, and extensible foundation for
implementing efficient linear algebra routines in C++.
