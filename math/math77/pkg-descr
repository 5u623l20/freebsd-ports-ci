MATH77 provides a foundational collection of mathematical subprogram
libraries specifically designed for use with Fortran 77. Developed by
CalTech, these libraries offer a robust and historically significant
suite of routines for various numerical computations.

Fortran 77 has been a cornerstone of scientific and engineering computing
for decades, and MATH77 complements this by offering optimized and
reliable implementations of common mathematical operations. These
subprograms typically cover areas such as:

-   Linear algebra (e.g., matrix operations, solving linear systems)
-   Numerical analysis (e.g., root finding, integration, differentiation)
-   Special functions (e.g., Bessel functions, error functions)

This package is particularly valuable for maintaining and developing
applications that rely on established Fortran 77 codebases, ensuring
accuracy and performance in numerical tasks.
