lll_spect evaluates Linear Congruential Pseudorandom Number Generators
(LCGs) using a normalized spectral test. This test measures an LCG's
statistical randomness.

It employs the Lenstra-Lenstra-Lovasz (LLL) basis reduction algorithm
to approximate the shortest vector, enabling efficient calculation in
polynomial time. This makes the spectral test practical for higher
dimensions.

Key features:

-   **LCG Quality Assessment**: Robust method for LCG statistical
    properties.
-   **High-Dimensional Testing**: Tests up to 24 dimensions for modern
    simulations.
-   **Parameter Optimization**: Includes examples for finding optimal
    LCG parameters.

lll_spect is invaluable for researchers and developers working with PRNGs,
helping select and validate LCGs for applications requiring strong
statistical properties.
