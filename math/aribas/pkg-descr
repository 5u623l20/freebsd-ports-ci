ARIBAS is an interactive interpreter designed for advanced arithmetic,
offering robust support for both big integer and multi-precision
floating-point calculations. Its Pascal/Modula-like syntax provides
a familiar and structured environment for users to perform complex
mathematical operations.

This powerful tool comes equipped with a rich set of built-in functions
specifically tailored for algorithmic number theory, including:

-   **Number Theoretic Functions**: Greatest Common Divisor (GCD),
    Jacobi symbol, and continued fraction expansions.
-   **Primality Testing**: Rabin probabilistic prime test for efficient
    identification of prime numbers.
-   **Integer Factorization Algorithms**:
    -   Quadratic sieve factorization for general integers.
    -   Pollard's rho factorization for finding smaller prime factors.

ARIBAS is an invaluable resource for mathematicians, computer scientists,
and cryptographers who require precise and efficient tools for number
theoretic research, cryptographic analysis, and other applications
involving large numbers and complex arithmetic. Its interactive nature
makes it ideal for experimentation and exploration of numerical properties.
