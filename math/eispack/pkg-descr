EISPACK is a classic software library for solving eigenvalue problems.
It provides a comprehensive collection of Fortran subroutines for
computing eigenvalues and eigenvectors of various types of matrices.

Originally developed by a team including B.T. Smith, J.M. Boyle, J.J.
Dongarra, B.S. Garbow, Y. Ikebe, V.C. Klema, and C.B. Moler, EISPACK
has been a foundational resource in numerical linear algebra. The
library is described in detail in:

1.  Smith et al., "Matrix Eigensystem Routines -- EISPACK Guide,"
    Lecture Notes in Computer Science, Vol. 6, Springer-Verlag, 1976.
2.  Garbow et al., "Matrix Eigensystem Routines -- EISPACK Guide
    Extension," Lecture Notes in Computer Science, Vol. 51,
    Springer-Verlag, 1977.

As a Fortran-based library, it primarily installs the compiled library
itself. EISPACK remains a valuable reference and tool for researchers
and developers working with eigenvalue computations, particularly in
scientific and engineering applications.
