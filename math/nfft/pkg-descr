NFFT is a C software library for computing Non-Equispaced Fast Fourier
Transforms (NFFT) and their various generalizations. It provides efficient
algorithms for scenarios where data points are not uniformly spaced,
a common occurrence in many scientific and engineering applications.

The library implements a comprehensive set of transforms, including:

-   **Non-Equispaced Fast Fourier Transform (NFFT)**:
    -   Forward transform (frequency to time/space domain).
    -   Adjoint transform (time/space to frequency domain).
-   **Generalizations**:
    -   NNFFT: For arbitrary nodes in both time and frequency domains.
    -   NFCT, NFST: Real-valued data, including (co)sine transforms.
    -   NFSFT: Transforms on the sphere S^2.
    -   NFSOFT: Transforms on the rotation group.
    -   NSFFT: Transforms on the hyperbolic cross.
-   **Generalized Inverse Transformations**: Based on iterative methods
    like CGNR/CGNE.

NFFT is an invaluable tool for researchers and developers in fields
such as medical imaging, radio astronomy, geophysics, and signal
processing, where non-uniform sampling is prevalent and efficient
Fourier analysis is critical.
