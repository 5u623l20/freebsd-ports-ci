RANDLIB is a comprehensive library of routines for generating various
types of random numbers and permutations. It provides a robust set of
functions for statistical simulations and modeling, making it a valuable
tool for researchers and developers.

The library offers routines to return:

-   **Continuous Random Deviates**: Beta, Chi-square, Exponential, F,
    Gamma, Noncentral Chi-square, Noncentral F, and Univariate Normal.
-   **Discrete Random Deviates**: Binomial, Negative Binomial, Multinomial,
    and Poisson.
-   **Uniform Random Deviates**: Real uniform deviates between specified
    limits, and integer uniform deviates between specified limits.
-   **Multivariate Normal Deviates**: With specified mean and covariance matrix.
-   **Random Permutations**: Generates random permutations of an integer array.
-   **Seed Generation**: Calculates seeds for the random number generator
    from a character string.

RANDLIB ensures a wide range of random number generation capabilities,
essential for Monte Carlo methods, statistical analysis, and other
applications requiring diverse and reliable random variates.
