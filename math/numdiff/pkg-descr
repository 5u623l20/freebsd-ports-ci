Numdiff is a specialized command-line utility designed for intelligent
comparison of files containing numerical data. Unlike standard `diff`
tools, Numdiff excels at identifying semantic differences between files
by intelligently handling numerical variations and formatting discrepancies.

Its core functionality allows users to compare putatively similar files
line by line and field by field, with key features including:

-   **Tolerance for Numeric Differences**: Ignores small numerical
    variations, focusing on significant changes.
-   **Format Agnostic Comparison**: Accommodates different numerical
    formats (e.g., scientific notation, varying precision), ensuring
    accurate comparisons regardless of presentation.
-   **Mixed Content Handling**: Capable of comparing files that contain
    both numerical fields and other types of data.

Numdiff is an invaluable tool for scientists, engineers, and developers
who frequently work with simulation outputs, experimental data, or
configuration files where minor numerical fluctuations or formatting
differences should not be flagged as significant changes. It streamlines
the process of verifying data integrity and tracking meaningful updates.
