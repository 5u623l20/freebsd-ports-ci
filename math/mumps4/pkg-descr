MUMPS (MUltifrontal Massively Parallel sparse direct Solver) is a
Fortran 90 and MPI-based software package for efficiently solving
large sparse linear systems. It uses dynamic distributed scheduling
to handle numerical fill-in and multi-user environments.

Key capabilities:

-   **Solution of Large Linear Systems**: Supports symmetric positive
    definite, general symmetric, and general unsymmetric matrices.
-   **Complex Arithmetic**: Version available for complex computations.
-   **Parallel/Uniprocessor Modes**: Offers both parallel (MPI) and
    uniprocessor factorization and solve phases.
-   **Enhanced Accuracy**: Includes iterative refinement and backward
    error analysis.
-   **Flexible Matrix Input**: Supports assembled, distributed assembled,
    and elemental formats.
-   **Advanced Features**: Partial factorization, Schur complement matrix.
-   **Integrated Orderings**: Interfaces with AMD, AMF, and PORD.

This Public Domain version of MUMPS is invaluable for researchers and
engineers in scientific computing and finite element analysis, requiring
high-performance sparse direct solvers.
