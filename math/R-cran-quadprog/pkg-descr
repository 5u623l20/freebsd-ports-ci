The R-cran-quadprog package provides an efficient and reliable implementation
of the dual method by Goldfarb and Idnani (1982, 1983) for solving
quadratic programming problems.

Quadratic programming is a type of mathematical optimization problem that
involves minimizing a quadratic objective function subject to linear
constraints. This package is particularly useful for tasks such as
portfolio optimization, support vector machines, and other statistical
modeling applications where such optimization is required.

Specifically, it solves problems of the form:
minimize   -d'b + 1/2 b'Db
subject to A'b >= b0

where 'b' is the vector of variables to be optimized, 'd' is a vector,
'D' is a symmetric positive-definite matrix, 'A' is a matrix, and 'b0'
is a vector. The routine ensures accurate and robust solutions for
these types of constrained optimization problems within the R environment.
