The R-cran-cvar package provides essential tools for risk management,
enabling the computation of Expected Shortfall (ES) and Value at Risk (VaR).
ES, also known as Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR), and VaR are key metrics
used to quantify potential financial losses in portfolios or investments.

This package offers high flexibility, allowing users to compute these
risk measures from various input types, including:

-   Quantile functions
-   Distribution functions
-   Random number generators
-   Probability density functions

It supports virtually any continuous distribution, making it adaptable
to diverse financial models. The functions are vectorized for efficient
computation across multiple arguments. The calculations are performed
directly from their definitions, as detailed by Acerbi and Tasche (2002).
Additionally, the package includes some support for GARCH (Generalized
Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity) models, further enhancing
its utility for analyzing financial time series volatility.

R-cran-cvar is an invaluable resource for financial analysts, risk managers,
and quantitative researchers working with R to assess and manage financial risk.
