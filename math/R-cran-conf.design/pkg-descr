The R-cran-conf.design package provides a specialized set of tools
within the R environment for the construction and manipulation of
confounded and fractional factorial designs. These experimental designs
are fundamental in statistics and engineering for efficiently studying
the effects of multiple factors on an outcome, especially when resources
are limited.

Confounded designs allow for the study of a large number of factors
with a smaller number of experimental runs by strategically sacrificing
information about higher-order interactions. Fractional factorial designs
are a type of confounded design that uses a fraction of the full factorial
experiment, making them highly efficient for screening important factors.

This library simplifies the process of setting up and analyzing such
designs, making it invaluable for:

-   Experiment design in industrial and scientific research.
-   Quality improvement and process optimization.
-   Situations where a full factorial experiment is impractical due to
    cost or time constraints.

By offering these simple yet powerful tools, R-cran-conf.design enables
researchers and practitioners to conduct more efficient and insightful
experiments.
