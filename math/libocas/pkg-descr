libocas implements the Optimized Cutting Plane Algorithm (OCAS), a
highly efficient method for training linear Support Vector Machine (SVM)
classifiers on large-scale datasets. SVMs are powerful supervised
learning models used for classification and regression analysis.

OCAS is specifically designed to handle big data, offering exceptional
computational efficiency that scales with O(m log m), where 'm' is the
sample size. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that OCAS significantly
outperforms many current state-of-the-art SVM solvers, making it ideal
for applications requiring fast and accurate classification.

Beyond core SVM training, libocas also includes the COFFIN framework,
which enables efficient training of translation-invariant image classifiers
from virtual examples. This feature is particularly useful for computer
vision tasks where robust image classification is needed, even with
limited real-world training data.

libocas is an invaluable library for machine learning practitioners,
data scientists, and researchers who need high-performance tools for
large-scale classification problems, especially in areas like image
recognition and pattern detection.
