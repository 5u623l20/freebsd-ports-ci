JAGS (Just Another Gibbs Sampler) is a program for analyzing Bayesian
hierarchical models using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation.
It provides a flexible framework for statistical modeling, especially
for complex models lacking analytical solutions.

JAGS builds upon the foundational concepts of the BUGS program, with
specific differences detailed in its documentation.

Key features:

-   **Bayesian Modeling**: Facilitates specification and analysis of
    Bayesian hierarchical models.
-   **MCMC Simulation**: Employs Gibbs sampling for efficient exploration
    of posterior distributions.
-   **Extensibility**: Allows users to define custom distributions and
    functions.
-   **Compatibility**: Many BUGS examples are adapted to run with JAGS,
    forming a robust test suite.

JAGS is an invaluable tool for statisticians and researchers in fields
like epidemiology, ecology, and social sciences, where Bayesian inference
and MCMC methods are widely applied.
