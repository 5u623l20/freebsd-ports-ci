Lcalc is a specialized program designed for computations involving
L-functions, which are fundamental objects in analytic number theory
with deep connections to prime numbers and other arithmetic properties.
This utility provides powerful capabilities for both calculating values
and finding zeros of these complex functions.

The package offers a dual approach for users:

-   **lcalc command-line program**: A direct and efficient tool for
    interactive computation and analysis of L-functions.
-   **L-function C++ class library**: Provides a robust and flexible
    interface for C++ programmers to integrate L-function computations
    into their own applications, leveraging the library's optimized
    algorithms.

Lcalc is an invaluable resource for mathematicians, number theorists,
and researchers working on problems related to the Riemann Hypothesis,
elliptic curves, and other areas of advanced number theory, offering
precise numerical tools for exploring the intricate behavior of L-functions.
