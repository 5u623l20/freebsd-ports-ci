Ent is a powerful command-line utility for applying statistical tests
to byte sequences within files. It provides insights into the randomness
and information density of data, crucial for evaluating various digital
processes.

Key analyses performed include:

-   **Entropy Calculation**: Measures information content per byte.
-   **Chi-Square Test**: Assesses uniformity of byte distribution.
-   **Arithmetic Mean and Monte Carlo Pi Estimation**: Statistical indicators.
-   **Serial Correlation Coefficient**: Detects patterns between bytes.

Ent is particularly useful for:

-   **Evaluating Pseudorandom Number Generators (PRNGs)**: Essential for
    cryptography and statistical sampling.
-   **Assessing Compression Algorithms**: Analyzing information density.
-   **Analyzing Data Streams**: Identifying non-random patterns.

It helps users ensure the integrity and quality of their data and algorithms.
