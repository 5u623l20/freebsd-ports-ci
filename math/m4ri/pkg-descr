M4RI is a high-performance library designed for rapid arithmetic operations
with dense matrices over the finite field F2 (GF(2)). F2, the field with
two elements (0 and 1), is fundamental in areas like coding theory,
cryptography, and computational algebra.

The library's name, M4RI, originates from its core implementation of the
"Method of the Four Russians" inversion algorithm, a technique published
by Gregory Bard. This algorithm, inspired by Kronrod's multiplication
method, provides significant speedups for matrix operations over F2.

M4RI offers optimized routines for various matrix manipulations, including:

-   **Multiplication**: Efficiently computes products of dense matrices.
-   **Inversion**: Fast calculation of matrix inverses.
-   **Gaussian Elimination**: Solves systems of linear equations.

This makes M4RI an invaluable tool for:

-   **Error-correcting codes**: Implementing and analyzing binary codes.
-   **Cryptography**: Developing and testing algorithms based on binary fields.
-   **Computational Algebra**: Solving problems in linear algebra over F2.

M4RI provides researchers and developers with a powerful and efficient
solution for numerical computations in specialized algebraic structures.
