clBLAS is a high-performance software library that provides optimized
BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms) functions implemented in OpenCL.
BLAS routines are fundamental building blocks for numerical linear algebra,
widely used in scientific computing, engineering, and data analysis.

The primary goal of clBLAS is to empower developers to leverage the
performance and power efficiency of heterogeneous computing environments.
It achieves this by:

-   **OpenCL Integration**: Directly utilizes OpenCL interfaces, allowing
    users full control over OpenCL state management for maximum
    performance and flexibility.
-   **Optimized Kernel Generation**: Automatically generates and enqueues
    optimized OpenCL kernels, freeing users from the complex task of
    writing, optimizing, and maintaining kernel code.

clBLAS is an invaluable resource for developers and researchers who need
to accelerate their linear algebra workloads by harnessing the parallel
processing capabilities of GPUs and other OpenCL-compatible devices.
It streamlines the development of high-performance computing applications
by providing a robust and efficient foundation for numerical operations.
