Xplot is a versatile and efficient graphing utility specifically designed
for the X11 windowing system. It provides a robust platform for visualizing
various types of data, making it particularly useful for scientific,
engineering, and network analysis applications.

Commonly employed to display TCP traces, Xplot can also handle other
time-series data, scatter plots, and more. Its interactive features allow
users to zoom, pan, and inspect data points directly within the X11
environment, offering a dynamic approach to data exploration and analysis.
