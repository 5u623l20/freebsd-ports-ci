The R-cran-nortest package provides a suite of five omnibus tests
for assessing the composite hypothesis of normality in statistical data.
Normality tests are crucial in statistics to determine if a data set
is well-modeled by a normal distribution, which is a common assumption
for many parametric statistical methods.

This package includes implementations of the following widely used tests:
-   Anderson-Darling test
-   Cramer-von Mises test
-   Shapiro-Francia test
-   Lilliefors test (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test with estimated parameters)
-   Pearson chi-square test

These tests are valuable tools for statisticians, researchers, and data
analysts working with R, enabling them to rigorously evaluate the
distributional assumptions of their data before applying further
statistical procedures.
