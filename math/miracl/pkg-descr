MIRACL (Multiprecision Integer and Rational Arithmetic C/C++ Library)
is a powerful Big Number Library for implementing cryptographic systems.
It provides primitives for integrating advanced number-theoretic
cryptography into real-world applications.

Primarily a tool for cryptographic system implementers, MIRACL offers
robust support for:

-   **Public Key Cryptography**: RSA, Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange, DSA.
-   **Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)**: Full support over GF(p)
    and GF(2m), including esoteric ECC schemes.
-   **Lucas Function Based Schemes**: Support for less common techniques.

MIRACL enables efficient work with large numbers foundational to modern
cryptography. It's a C library with a C++ wrapper that simplifies
program development, with examples in both languages.

This library is invaluable for security researchers, cryptographers,
and developers building secure communication protocols, digital
signature systems, and other applications requiring high-assurance
cryptographic primitives.
