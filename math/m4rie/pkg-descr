M4RIE is a high-performance library dedicated to fast arithmetic operations
with dense matrices over finite fields of the form GF(2^e), where 'e'
ranges from 2 to 16. Finite fields, also known as Galois fields, are
fundamental in areas like coding theory, cryptography, and computational
algebra.

Building upon the capabilities of the M4RI library, M4RIE extends its
functionality to support these larger finite fields, providing optimized
routines for matrix manipulations such as multiplication, inversion,
and Gaussian elimination. This makes it an invaluable tool for:

-   **Error-correcting codes**: Designing and implementing robust codes
    for data transmission and storage.
-   **Cryptography**: Developing and analyzing cryptographic algorithms
    that rely on finite field arithmetic.
-   **Computational Algebra**: Solving systems of linear equations and
    performing other algebraic computations over specific finite fields.

M4RIE offers researchers and developers a powerful and efficient solution
for numerical computations in specialized algebraic structures, crucial
for various advanced scientific and engineering applications.
