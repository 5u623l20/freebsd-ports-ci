ATLAS (Automatically Tuned Linear Algebra Software) is a high-performance
software library for numerical linear algebra. It focuses on applying
empirical optimization techniques to deliver portable and efficient
performance across diverse hardware architectures.

ATLAS provides optimized implementations of:

-   **BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms)**: Offers C and Fortran77
    interfaces for Level 1, 2, and 3 BLAS routines, crucial for vector,
    matrix-vector, and matrix-matrix operations. Both serial (thread-safe)
    and multi-threaded versions are available.
-   **LAPACK (Linear Algebra Package)**: Includes enhanced versions of
    key LAPACK routines, providing efficient solutions for problems
    like solving systems of linear equations, eigenvalue problems, and
    singular value decomposition.

The project's core strength lies in its ability to automatically tune
itself to the specific characteristics of the underlying hardware during
installation, ensuring optimal performance. ATLAS is an invaluable
resource for scientific computing, engineering simulations, and any
application requiring fast and reliable linear algebra computations.
