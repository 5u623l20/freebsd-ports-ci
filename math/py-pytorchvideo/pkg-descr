PyTorchVideo is a comprehensive deep learning library specifically
designed to accelerate research and development in video understanding.
Built upon the popular PyTorch framework, it offers a rich collection
of reusable, modular, and highly efficient components tailored for
video-centric deep learning tasks.

This library streamlines the process of building and deploying video
understanding models by providing:

-   **Pre-trained Video Models**: A diverse set of state-of-the-art
    architectures optimized for video data.
-   **Video Datasets**: Tools and utilities for handling and processing
    various video datasets.
-   **Video-Specific Transforms**: Efficient data augmentation and
    preprocessing techniques adapted for temporal and spatial video
    characteristics.

PyTorchVideo empowers researchers and developers to tackle challenging
problems such as action recognition, video classification, and object
tracking in videos with greater ease and efficiency. Its modular design
fosters rapid experimentation and allows for seamless integration into
existing PyTorch workflows, making it an invaluable resource for the
computer vision community.
