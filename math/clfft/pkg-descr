clFFT is a high-performance software library providing optimized Fast
Fourier Transform (FFT) functions implemented in OpenCL. The FFT is a
fundamental algorithm in digital signal processing and numerical analysis,
used for tasks such as spectral analysis, image processing, and solving
partial differential equations.

Leveraging the OpenCL framework, clFFT enables efficient computation
of FFTs on a wide range of parallel processing devices. Its key features
include:

-   **GPU Acceleration**: Primarily designed to harness the power of
    Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) for significant speedups in FFT
    computations.
-   **CPU Support**: Also supports execution on Central Processing Units
    (CPUs), which is beneficial for debugging, development, and
    heterogeneous computing environments where a mix of device types
    is utilized.
-   **OpenCL Standard**: Adheres to the OpenCL standard, ensuring
    portability across different hardware vendors and platforms.

clFFT is an invaluable resource for developers and researchers who need
to perform fast and efficient Fourier transforms on large datasets,
particularly in applications that can benefit from the parallel
processing capabilities of modern GPUs and multi-core CPUs.
