RngStreams is a C implementation of a high-quality uniform random
number generator (RNG) that provides support for multiple "independent"
streams of random numbers. This feature is crucial for parallel and
distributed simulations, ensuring that different parts of a simulation
can draw from distinct, non-overlapping sequences of random numbers.

Developed by Pierre L'Ecuyer and Richard Simard, RngStreams is designed
to offer statistically sound and reproducible random number sequences.
Its core strength lies in managing multiple streams, which is essential
for:

-   **Parallel Simulations**: Running independent simulation replicates
    concurrently.
-   **Distributed Computing**: Ensuring unique random number sequences
    across different processors or nodes.
-   **Reproducibility**: Allowing for the exact replication of simulation
    results by controlling the state of each stream.

This GNU-style package is compiled and maintained by Josef Leydold,
and is released under the GNU Public License (GPL). RngStreams is an
invaluable tool for researchers and developers in Monte Carlo methods,
statistical modeling, and any application requiring robust and manageable
random number generation.
