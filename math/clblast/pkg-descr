CLBlast is a cutting-edge, lightweight, and highly performant OpenCL
BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms) library. It provides efficient
and accelerated linear algebra computations on OpenCL-compatible devices.

BLAS routines are fundamental building blocks for numerical algorithms
in scientific computing, machine learning, and data analysis. CLBlast
leverages OpenCL to offload these tasks to GPUs and other accelerators,
significantly speeding up applications.

Key features and benefits:

-   **Modern Design**: Built with contemporary OpenCL practices for
    optimal performance.
-   **Lightweight Footprint**: Minimizes overhead for diverse systems.
-   **High Performance**: Achieves superior execution speeds through
    careful optimization.
-   **Tunable**: Allows fine-grained control to extract maximum
    performance from specific hardware (Intel, AMD, NVIDIA accelerators).

CLBlast is an invaluable resource for developers and researchers seeking
to accelerate numerical workloads by harnessing parallel processing
capabilities of modern hardware through OpenCL.
