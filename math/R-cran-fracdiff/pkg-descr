The R-cran-fracdiff package provides robust functionality for the
maximum likelihood estimation of parameters in fractionally differenced
ARIMA(p,d,q) models. These models are a powerful extension of traditional
ARIMA models, designed to capture long-range dependence in time series data,
where the 'd' parameter (differencing order) can be a non-integer value.

Fractionally differenced ARIMA models are particularly useful for
analyzing phenomena that exhibit persistent memory effects, such as:

-   Financial time series (e.g., stock prices, volatility)
-   Hydrological data (e.g., river flows, rainfall)
-   Environmental data (e.g., temperature anomalies)
-   Long-memory processes in various scientific and engineering fields

Based on the methodology by Haslett and Raftery (Applied Statistics, 1989),
this package offers a reliable and statistically sound approach to
modeling time series with fractional integration. It enables researchers
and practitioners in R to accurately estimate the parameters of these
complex models, leading to more precise forecasts and a deeper understanding
of long-memory processes.
