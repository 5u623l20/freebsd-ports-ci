TVMet (Tiny Vector and Matrix template library) is a high-performance
C++ library designed for efficient linear algebra operations, particularly
suited for resource-constrained or performance-critical applications.
It leverages advanced C++ features like Meta-programming and Expression
Templates to achieve remarkable speed and memory efficiency.

The core innovation of TVMet lies in its ability to evaluate many
mathematical expressions involving vectors and matrices at compile time.
This approach eliminates the creation of costly temporary objects during
runtime, leading to:

-   **Exceptional Performance**: Significantly faster execution compared
    to traditional approaches.
-   **Minimal Memory Footprint**: Reduced memory consumption, making it
    ideal for embedded systems or applications with strict memory budgets.
-   **Static Dimensioning**: Vector and matrix dimensions are fixed at
    compile time, allowing for aggressive optimizations and compile-time
    error checking.

TVMet is an excellent choice for developers working on scientific simulations,
game development, embedded systems, or any project where fast and
memory-efficient linear algebra is paramount. It provides a robust and
optimized solution for numerical computations without compromising on
performance or resource usage.
