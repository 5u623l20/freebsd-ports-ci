Solitaire is a unique encryption system designed by renowned cryptographer
Bruce Schneier, based on the manipulation of a deck of playing cards.
While ingeniously crafted for manual execution by a human, this system
can also be implemented computationally.

This package provides the reference implementation of the Solitaire
encryption algorithm, programmed in Perl. It serves as a faithful
digital representation of Schneier's original design, allowing for
both study and practical application.

Key components installed:

-   **solitaire executable**: The primary program for performing
    encryption and decryption.
-   **Source code and test vectors**: Located in share/doc/solitaire,
    these resources are invaluable for understanding the algorithm's
    mechanics and verifying its correctness.

**IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTE**: Before relying on this implementation for
any real-world security applications, it is strongly advised to
thoroughly read the official website and understand the nuances and
limitations of the Solitaire algorithm.
