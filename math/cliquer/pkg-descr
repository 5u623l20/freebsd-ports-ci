Cliquer is a highly efficient C library designed for finding cliques
in arbitrary weighted graphs. In graph theory, a clique is a subset
of vertices where every pair of vertices is connected by an edge.
Finding cliques is a fundamental problem with applications in social
network analysis, bioinformatics, and computer vision.

This library implements an exact branch-and-bound algorithm developed
by Patric Ostergard, ensuring optimal solutions. Cliquer is meticulously
designed to be:

-   **Efficient**: Optimized for performance, even on complex graphs.
-   **Flexible**: Adaptable to various graph structures and problem
    specifications.
-   **Easy to Use**: Provides a straightforward API for integration
    into other applications.

Note that this port utilizes a version of Cliquer that has been
autotoolized by Dima Pasechnik, enhancing its build system and
portability. This ensures a robust and well-maintained package.

Cliquer is an invaluable resource for researchers and developers working
with graph algorithms, offering a powerful and reliable tool for
identifying dense subgraphs and solving related combinatorial problems.
