Emc2 is a portable, interactive, and graphical editor for two-dimensional
mesh geometries. It provides a comprehensive environment for creating,
modifying, and analyzing mesh structures, making it an invaluable tool
for numerical simulations and engineering applications.

Key functionalities include:

-   **Geometry Creation and Modification**: Functions similar to CAD
    software for designing and altering 2D shapes.
-   **Mesh Definition**: Define line discretizations, subdomains, and
    assign reference numbers for boundary conditions and material properties.
-   **Mesh Generation**: Create grid and Delaunay-Voronoi meshes composed
    of triangles or quadrilaterals.
-   **Mesh Manipulation**: Regularize, rotate, and modify meshes by
    adding, removing, or moving vertices, ensuring optimal mesh quality.

Emc2 streamlines the preprocessing stage for finite element analysis,
computational fluid dynamics, and other simulation methods. For enhanced
mesh generation capabilities, it is highly suggested that users also
install the `math/bamg` port.
