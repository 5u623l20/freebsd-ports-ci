CRlibm is an efficient and rigorously proven mathematical library
providing correctly rounded implementations of double-precision C99
standard elementary functions. It supports all four IEEE-754 rounding
modes, offering high accuracy and reliability for numerical computations.

Designed for transparent replacement of existing `libm` implementations,
CRlibm maintains efficiency in average and worst-case time, along with
optimized memory consumption. Its development includes extensive
documentation with formal proofs for each function, making it an
excellent resource for understanding software elementary function
development.

CRlibm also integrates scslib (Software Carry Save Library), a lightweight
multiple-precision library. scslib is tailored for CRlibm's needs,
offering precision up to a few hundred bits, portability, IEEE
floating-point compatibility, and performance comparable to or better
than GMP, all within a small footprint. It efficiently handles
multiple-precision additions, subtractions, multiplications, and conversions
by avoiding carry propagations during multiplication.

CRlibm is an invaluable tool for applications demanding high-precision,
correctly rounded mathematical functions, particularly in scientific
computing, financial modeling, and other fields where numerical accuracy
is paramount.
