The R-cran-qualityTools package provides a comprehensive suite of
statistical methods essential for Quality Science and Six Sigma
Quality Management, particularly supporting the Define, Measure,
Analyze, Improve, and Control (DMAIC) cycle.

Key functionalities include:

-   **Distribution Fitting**: Tools for fitting various statistical
    distributions to data.
-   **Process Capability Analysis**: Calculation of normal and non-normal
    process capability indices.
-   **Measurement Systems Analysis (MSA)**: Techniques such as gauge
    capability indices and Gauge Repeatability and Reproducibility (GR&R)
    studies.
-   **Experimental Design**: Support for factorial and fractional
    factorial designs.
-   **Response Surface Methods**: Including the use of desirability functions.

This package is an invaluable resource for quality engineers, statisticians,
and practitioners implementing Six Sigma methodologies, enabling robust
analysis and improvement of processes.
