GRPN is a powerful and intuitive Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) calculator
designed for the X Window System, built with the GIMP Toolkit (GTK).
RPN calculators streamline complex calculations by eliminating the need
for parentheses and prioritizing operational flow.

This graphical calculator offers extensive support for various number
types and display formats, making it a versatile tool for mathematicians,
engineers, and students. Key features include:

-   **Diverse Data Types**: Handles calculations with real numbers,
    complex numbers, matrices, and complex matrices.
-   **Flexible Radix Modes**: Numbers can be displayed in four different
    radix modes (e.g., binary, octal, decimal, hexadecimal) for enhanced
    versatility in various computing contexts.
-   **Complex Number Representation**: Complex numbers can be viewed in
    either Cartesian (a + bi) or polar (r * e^(i*theta)) form, catering
    to different analytical needs.

GRPN provides a robust and user-friendly environment for performing
advanced mathematical computations, combining the efficiency of RPN
with the visual clarity of a modern graphical interface.
