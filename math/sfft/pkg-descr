sfft is an optimized library for computing Discrete Fourier Transforms
(DFTs) of signals with a sparse frequency domain. It exploits this
sparsity for significantly more efficient computations than traditional
FFT algorithms.

Developed by a team at MIT CSAIL (Hassanieh, Indyk, Katabi, Price),
sfft represents a breakthrough in sparse Fourier transform techniques.
Further performance optimizations were contributed by J. Schumacher at
ETH Zurich.

This library is beneficial for applications where:

-   **Signals have few dominant frequencies**: E.g., compressed sensing,
    spectral analysis of sparse signals.
-   **Computational speed is critical**: Offering faster processing.
-   **Resource efficiency is desired**: Reducing computational load.

sfft provides a powerful tool for researchers and engineers working with
sparse spectral data, enabling faster analysis and processing.
