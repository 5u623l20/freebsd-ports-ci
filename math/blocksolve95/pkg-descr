BlockSolve95 is a scalable parallel software library designed for the
efficient solution of large, sparse linear systems. It is particularly
optimized for problems arising from physical models, especially those
with multiple degrees of freedom at each node (e.g., finite element
methods in structural engineering).

The library effectively handles problems with this local structure,
while also remaining reasonably efficient for systems with a single
degree of freedom per node (e.g., three-dimensional Poisson problems).

BlockSolve95 is a general-purpose solver, requiring only that matrices
are sparse and symmetric in structure (though not necessarily in value).
It provides a robust solution for complex scientific and engineering
simulations that demand high-performance parallel computation for
large sparse linear systems.
