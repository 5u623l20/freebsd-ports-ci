LRNG (Lightweight Random Number Generator) is a comprehensive collection of
high-quality, uniform pseudorandom number generators (PRNGs). Implemented in C,
LRNG is built upon robust algorithms developed by prominent researchers
Francois Panneton, Pierre L'Ecuyer, and Makoto Matsumoto.

This library provides a reliable and efficient solution for applications
requiring statistically sound random numbers, such as simulations,
cryptography, and scientific computing. Its lightweight nature makes it
suitable for integration into various projects without significant overhead.
