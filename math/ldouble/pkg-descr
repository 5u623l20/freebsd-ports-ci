The ldouble library provides a comprehensive collection of elementary
mathematical functions, probability functions, and elliptic integrals,
all implemented with extended precision. This library is specifically
designed for computations requiring higher accuracy than standard
double-precision floating-point numbers.

It supports 80-bit long double precision on x86 architectures and
128-bit long double precision where available, offering enhanced
numerical stability and reduced round-off errors for demanding
scientific and engineering applications. This extended precision is
crucial for fields such as:

-   Computational physics and chemistry
-   High-precision financial modeling
-   Numerical analysis and algorithm development
-   Any application where accumulated floating-point errors can lead
    to significant inaccuracies.

By leveraging ldouble, developers can achieve greater confidence in the
accuracy of their complex mathematical computations.
