JLaTeXMath is a Java API designed to render mathematical formulas
written in LaTeX. It provides a robust solution for displaying complex
mathematical expressions within Java applications, with UTF-8 as the
default encoding.

The library supports a wide range of LaTeX commands and features, including:

-   **Comprehensive Command Support**: Most standard LaTeX commands,
    macros from `amsmath`, and symbols from `amssymb` and `stmaryrd`.
-   **Graphics Integration**: Supports `\includegraphics` (without options)
    and `\over` macro.
-   **Extended Accents**: Includes accents from the `amsxtra` package.
-   **Color/Graphics Manipulation**: Provides `\definecolor`, `\textcolor`,
    `\colorbox`, `\fcolorbox` (from `color` package), and `\rotatebox`,
    `\reflectbox`, `\scalebox` (from `graphicx`).
-   **Unicode/Font Support**: Detects and loads fonts for Latin, Cyrillic,
    and Greek Unicode characters.
-   **Custom Commands/Environments**: Supports `\newcommand`, `\newenvironment`,
    `array`, `matrix`, `pmatrix`, `eqnarray`, and `cases` environments.
-   **Embedded Fonts**: Fonts embedded in JAR for PDF, PS, EPS generation
    via FOP 0.95; SVG export also supported.

JLaTeXMath is an invaluable tool for Java developers needing to integrate
high-quality mathematical typesetting into their applications.
