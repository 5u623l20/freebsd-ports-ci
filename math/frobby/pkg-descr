Frobby is a powerful software system and project dedicated to computations
with monomial ideals. As free software, it serves as a vital tool for
computational and mathematical research in this specialized area of algebra.

Its extensive functionality includes:

-   **Ideal Properties**: Euler characteristic, Hilbert series, maximal
    standard monomials, primary decomposition, irreducible decomposition,
    Alexander dual, and associated primes.
-   **Ideal Operations**: Minimization and intersection of monomial ideals.
-   **Frobenius Problems**: Computation of Frobenius problems, even with
    very large numbers, leveraging the capabilities of 4ti2.
-   **Interoperability**: Supports translation between formats compatible
    with various computer algebra systems, including Macaulay2, Monos,
    4ti2, CoCoA4, and Singular. This allows Frobby to seamlessly integrate
    with and extend the capabilities of these systems.

Frobby is an invaluable resource for researchers and students in
commutative algebra, algebraic geometry, and computational mathematics,
providing a flexible and robust platform for exploring the intricate
properties of monomial ideals.
