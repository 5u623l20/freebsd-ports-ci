The R-cran-magic package provides efficient, vectorized algorithms for
creating and investigating magic squares and hypercubes. It includes
functions for manipulating and analyzing multi-dimensional arrays.

Key features:

-   **Magic Square Creation**: Methods for generating normal magic
    squares of any order greater than 2.
-   **Analysis Tools**: Functions for the manipulation and analysis of
    arbitrarily dimensioned arrays, including numerical verification
    of magic square properties (e.g., determinant of odd-ordered
    semimagic squares).
-   **Antimagic Functionality**: Support for antimagic squares and
    related concepts.

The package aims to be a comprehensive computerized embodiment of magic
square knowledge, offering direct numerical verification of their
properties. It is a valuable resource for mathematicians, statisticians,
and R users interested in combinatorial designs and recreational mathematics.
