Ngraph is a versatile 2D plotting tool designed for students, scientists,
and engineers. It specializes in visualizing numerical data read from
general ASCII text files, providing a straightforward way to generate
graphs for analysis and presentation.

Key features include:

-   **Data Visualization**: Creates 2-dimensional plots from numerical
    data stored in ASCII text files.
-   **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed for ease of use, catering to
    users in scientific and engineering disciplines.
-   **Kanji Font Support**: (Optional) Supports Kanji fonts for Japanese
    language display, configurable via environment variables and specific
    font installations (e.g., `ja-ngraph-fonts`, `ja-kanji18`, `ja-kanji26`).
    Users can also customize font settings in `Ngraph.ini`.

Ngraph provides a practical and accessible solution for generating
scientific plots, making it a valuable utility for data analysis and
graphical representation of experimental or simulated results.
