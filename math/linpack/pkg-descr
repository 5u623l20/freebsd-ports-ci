LINPACK is a foundational software library for performing numerical
linear algebra. Developed by a distinguished team including Jack Dongarra,
Jim Bunch, Cleve Moler, and Pete Stewart, it was released on February 1, 1984.

Despite its age, LINPACK remains highly significant in the field of
high-performance computing. It provides a robust collection of Fortran
subroutines for solving common problems in linear algebra, such as:

-   Solving systems of linear equations
-   Least squares solutions
-   Eigenvalue problems
-   Matrix factorization (e.g., LU, Cholesky, QR)

Historically, LINPACK has been a cornerstone for benchmarking the
performance of supercomputers (via the LINPACK Benchmark). It also
formed a critical component of early numerical software environments,
including MATLAB. While more modern libraries exist, LINPACK's
algorithms are still widely respected for their accuracy and efficiency,
making it a valuable resource for understanding and implementing core
linear algebra operations.
