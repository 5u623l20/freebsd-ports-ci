TomsFastMath (TFM) is a highly optimized and portable fixed-precision
mathematics library, specifically engineered for exceptionally fast
exponentiation operations. Designed for environments where performance
is critical, TFM provides a robust solution for cryptographic applications,
large number arithmetic, and other computational tasks demanding rapid
modular exponentiation.

The library's fixed-precision nature means it operates on integers of
a predetermined size, offering predictable performance characteristics
and efficient memory usage. Its primary strength lies in its ability
to perform modular exponentiation (e.g., a^b mod n) with remarkable speed,
a fundamental operation in public-key cryptography algorithms like RSA
and Diffie-Hellman.

TFM's portability ensures it can be easily integrated into various
projects across different platforms, making it a valuable asset for
developers building secure communication protocols, digital signatures,
or any system requiring high-speed, fixed-precision arithmetic.
