TRLAN is a portable and modular Fortran 90 software package that
implements the thick-restart Lanczos method. This advanced numerical
technique is specifically designed for efficiently solving large-scale
eigenvalue problems, particularly when only a small subset of eigenvalues
and their corresponding eigenvectors are required.

TRLAN excels in scenarios involving real symmetric or complex Hermitian
matrices that are too large to be stored entirely in computer memory.
Its key features include:

-   **Memory Efficiency**: Handles very large matrices by avoiding full
    storage, making it suitable for high-performance computing.
-   **Targeted Eigenvalue Computation**: Focuses on finding a few desired
    eigenvalues and eigenvectors, rather than the entire spectrum.
-   **BLAS and LAPACK Integration**: Leverages highly optimized Basic
    Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS) and Linear Algebra Package (LAPACK)
    routines for core arithmetic computations, ensuring high performance.
-   **Checkpointing Capability**: Supports writing checkpoint files,
    allowing computations to be paused and restarted later, which is
    crucial for long-running simulations or in case of system interruptions.

TRLAN is an invaluable tool for researchers and engineers in fields
such as quantum chemistry, structural analysis, and materials science,
where efficient and robust solutions to large eigenvalue problems are essential.
