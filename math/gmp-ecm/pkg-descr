GMP-ECM is a specialized program for efficient integer factorization
using the Elliptic Curve Method (ECM). This method excels at finding
relatively small prime factors of very large numbers, making it a
crucial tool in computational number theory and cryptography.

It leverages the high-performance GNU MP (Multiple Precision) library
for arbitrary-precision arithmetic, allowing it to handle integers of
virtually any size with accuracy and speed.

Key applications include:

-   **Cryptanalysis**: Analyzing cryptographic systems (e.g., RSA).
-   **Number Theory Research**: Exploring properties of integers and
    primes.
-   **Computational Mathematics**: Decomposing numbers into prime
    components.

GMP-ECM offers a robust and optimized solution for researchers,
cryptographers, and mathematicians needing efficient large integer
factorization.
