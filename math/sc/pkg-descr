sc (spreadsheet calculator) is a powerful and flexible terminal-based
spreadsheet program. It operates on rectangular tables, providing a
familiar interface of rows and columns for data organization and analysis.
Unlike graphical spreadsheets, sc is designed for efficiency and accessibility
within text-based environments.

Upon invocation, sc presents an organized table of cells. If no file
argument is provided, it starts with an empty table, ready for user input.
Each cell in the spreadsheet can store and display various types of data:

-   **Numeric Values**: Direct numerical entries.
-   **Label Strings**: Textual descriptions or headers.
-   **Expressions (Formulas)**: Dynamic calculations that evaluate to
    either a numeric value or a label string. These formulas can
    reference other cell values, enabling complex inter-cell dependencies
    and powerful data manipulation.

sc is an invaluable tool for users who prefer a command-line interface
for data management, financial calculations, or any task requiring
spreadsheet functionality without the overhead of a graphical environment.
Its robust formula support and cell-based operations make it a versatile
choice for data analysis and reporting.
