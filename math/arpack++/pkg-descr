ARPACK++ provides an object-oriented C++ interface to ARPACK (ARnoldi
PACKage), a widely used Fortran library for solving large-scale
eigenvalue problems. This wrapper allows C++ developers to leverage
ARPACK's power within a modern programming paradigm.

ARPACK is known for efficiently computing a few eigenvalues and
eigenvectors of large, sparse matrices, making it vital in quantum
mechanics, structural engineering, and data analysis. ARPACK++ retains
the original Fortran package's strengths:

-   **Full Capability**: Access to all ARPACK functionalities for
    various eigenvalue problems.
-   **High Performance**: Maintains computational speed and efficiency.
-   **Exceptional Accuracy**: Delivers precise numerical results.
-   **Low Memory Requirements**: Optimized for large matrices.

By integrating ARPACK's robust numerical algorithms with C++ flexibility,
ARPACK++ offers a powerful solution for complex eigenvalue computations.
