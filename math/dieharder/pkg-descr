Dieharder is a comprehensive, GPL-licensed test suite for evaluating
the quality of random number generators (RNGs). It builds upon the
legacy of George Marsaglia's "Diehard battery of tests" and expands
upon it with modern statistical methodologies.

This suite incorporates a diverse collection of tests, including:

-   **Diehard Tests**: Classic tests for assessing RNG randomness.
-   **NIST Statistical Test Suite (STS)**: Tests developed by the
    National Institute for Standards and Technology.
-   **New Tests**: Additional tests developed by the project's author.

Dieharder is designed with extensibility in mind, allowing for the
incorporation of new tests and analysis methods. A key design goal is
to provide not just pass/fail results, but also insights into *why* an
RNG might fail a particular test, offering diagnostic information
(e.g., displaying histograms for bit distributions).

This makes Dieharder an invaluable tool for researchers, cryptographers,
and developers who require rigorous validation of RNGs for applications
in simulations, security, and statistical analysis.
