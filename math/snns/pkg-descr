SNNS (Stuttgart Neural Network Simulator) is a comprehensive software
simulator for neural networks, developed at the Institute for Parallel
and Distributed High Performance Systems (IPVR) at the University of
Stuttgart. It provides an efficient and flexible environment for
research and application of neural networks.

SNNS comprises two main components:

1.  **Simulator Kernel (C-based)**: This core component handles internal
    network data structures, learning, and recall operations. It supports
    arbitrary network topologies and the concept of sites. The kernel
    can be extended with user-defined activation functions, output
    functions, site functions, and learning procedures written in C.
    It can also be embedded in custom applications.
2.  **Graphical User Interface (XGUI)**: Built on top of the kernel,
    XGUI provides 2D and 3D graphical representations of neural networks.
    It controls the kernel during simulation and includes an integrated
    network editor for creating, manipulating, and visualizing neural
    nets interactively.

SNNS is an invaluable tool for researchers, students, and developers
working with neural networks, offering a powerful platform for
experimentation, simulation, and understanding of complex neural models.
