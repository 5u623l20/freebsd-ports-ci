primegen is a highly optimized and fast library designed for generating
prime numbers in sequential order. It provides an efficient solution
for applications requiring lists of primes, particularly for numbers
within the 32-bit range.

A key feature of primegen is its use of the Sieve of Atkin, an advanced
algorithm that significantly outperforms the traditional Sieve of
Eratosthenes for generating primes up to a given limit. This optimization
results in impressive performance:

-   Generates 50,847,534 primes up to 1,000,000,000 in approximately
    8 seconds on a Pentium II-350.
-   Prints these primes in decimal format in about 35 seconds on the
    same hardware.

While primegen can theoretically generate primes up to 10^15, its
performance is specifically optimized for primes that fit within 32-bit
integers. It is an invaluable tool for:

-   **Number Theory Research**: Exploring properties of prime numbers.
-   **Cryptography**: Generating primes for key creation or testing.
-   **Computational Mathematics**: Any application requiring efficient
    prime number generation.
