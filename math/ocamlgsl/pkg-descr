OCamlGSL provides a robust and comprehensive interface to the GNU
Scientific Library (GSL) for the Objective Caml (OCaml) programming
language. The GSL is a vast collection of numerical routines for
scientific computing, offering a wide range of mathematical functions
and algorithms.

By bridging OCaml with GSL, OCamlGSL empowers OCaml developers to
leverage high-performance, well-tested numerical capabilities directly
within their functional programming environment. This integration is
particularly beneficial for applications requiring:

-   **Numerical Analysis**: Solving differential equations, integration,
    differentiation, root finding.
-   **Linear Algebra**: Matrix operations, eigenvalue problems, linear systems.
-   **Statistics**: Random number generation, probability distributions,
    statistical tests.
-   **Special Functions**: Bessel functions, Gamma functions, error functions.
-   **Optimization**: Minimization and maximization algorithms.

OCamlGSL allows OCaml programmers to perform complex scientific and
mathematical computations with the efficiency and reliability of GSL,
while retaining the expressiveness and safety features of OCaml.
