SVGMath is a specialized command-line utility written entirely in Python
that facilitates the conversion of MathML (Mathematical Markup Language)
expressions into SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) format.

MathML is an XML-based markup language for describing mathematical
notation, while SVG is an XML-based vector image format for two-dimensional
graphics. The conversion provided by SVGMath is highly beneficial for:

-   **High-quality rendering**: SVG ensures that mathematical equations
    are rendered sharply and clearly at any resolution, making them ideal
    for web display, print, and presentations.
-   **Web integration**: Easily embed complex mathematical formulas into
    web pages and other digital documents without relying on raster images
    or specialized fonts.
-   **Accessibility**: Vector graphics maintain their quality when scaled,
    improving readability for users with varying display needs.

As a pure Python implementation, SVGMath offers a portable and easily
integrable solution for developers and content creators who need to
present mathematical content in a visually appealing and scalable format.
