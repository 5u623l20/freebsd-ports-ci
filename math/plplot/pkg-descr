PLplot is a powerful and versatile library of C functions designed for
generating high-quality scientific plots from programs written in C,
C++, or Fortran. It provides a comprehensive set of tools for visualizing
data across various scientific and engineering disciplines.

Key plotting capabilities include:

-   **Diverse Plot Types**: Supports standard x-y plots, semilog plots,
    log-log plots, contour plots, 3D plots, mesh plots, bar charts, and
    pie charts.
-   **Multi-Graph Layouts**: Allows multiple graphs (of varying sizes)
    on a single page, with multiple lines per graph.
-   **Extensive Customization**: Offers different line styles, widths,
    and colors. Features a virtually infinite number of distinct area
    fill patterns.
-   **Rich Character Set**: Includes an extended character set with four
    fonts, the Greek alphabet, and a wide array of mathematical, musical,
    and other symbols. Fonts are scalable to any desired size.
-   **Device Agnostic Output**: Supports a variety of output devices,
    with an extensible architecture for easily adding new device drivers.

PLplot is an invaluable resource for scientists, engineers, and researchers
who need to create precise, customizable, and visually appealing plots
directly from their numerical applications.
