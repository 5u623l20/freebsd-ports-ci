The Scilab Wavelet Toolbox (SWT) is a free software package designed
to provide comprehensive wavelet analysis tools within the Scilab
environment. Wavelet analysis is a powerful signal processing technique
used for analyzing signals and images across various scales.

SWT enables users to perform a wide range of wavelet-based operations
on both 1-D signals and 2-D images. Key functionalities include:

-   **Discrete Fast Wavelet Transform (DFWT)**: Efficient computation
    of wavelet transforms.
-   **Daubechies Wavelets**: Support for a popular family of wavelets.
-   **1-D Signal Decomposition and Reconstruction**:
    -   Single-level decomposition and reconstruction.
    -   Multi-level decomposition and reconstruction.
-   **2-D Image Decomposition and Reconstruction**:
    -   Single-level decomposition and reconstruction.
    -   Multi-level decomposition and reconstruction.

SWT is compatible with most operating systems, including GNU/Linux, BSD,
and Windows. It is designed to integrate seamlessly with Scilab Image
Processing Toolboxes (e.g., SIP) for displaying 2-D results. This toolbox
is an invaluable resource for engineers, researchers, and students working
in signal and image processing, data compression, and feature extraction.
