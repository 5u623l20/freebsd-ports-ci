Gexpr is a powerful and lightweight command-line calculator designed
for shell environments. It supports floating-point arithmetic, a wide
range of standard C mathematical functions, and relational operators
for conditional expressions. Gexpr offers flexible output options,
allowing results to be displayed in binary, octal, decimal, or
hexadecimal bases.

It serves as an excellent alternative to traditional command-line
calculators like bc(1), especially when a more streamlined and
feature-rich solution is desired. Furthermore, gexpr can be seamlessly
integrated into shell scripts, providing robust floating-point math
capabilities for automation and complex calculations.
