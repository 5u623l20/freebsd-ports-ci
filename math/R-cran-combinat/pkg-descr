The R-cran-combinat package provides a collection of essential routines
for combinatorial mathematics within the R environment. Combinatorics is
a branch of mathematics concerning the study of finite or countable
discrete structures.

This package offers functions to generate and manipulate various combinatorial
objects, including permutations, combinations, and partitions. It is
invaluable for researchers, statisticians, and data scientists who need
to perform tasks such as:

-   Generating all possible orderings of a set of items.
-   Selecting subsets of items without regard to their order.
-   Enumerating ways to divide a set into non-empty subsets.

By providing these fundamental combinatorial tools, R-cran-combinat
facilitates a wide range of applications in probability, statistics,
computer science, and experimental design.
