GLgraph is a powerful and interactive visualization tool designed to
render complex mathematical functions in a graphical environment.
Leveraging OpenGL, it provides dynamic 3D and 4D representations,
making abstract mathematical concepts tangible and explorable.

This utility excels at visualizing functions with up to three independent
variables (typically denoted as x, z, and t). Notably, it can generate
stunning 4D function plots, where three dimensions represent space and
the fourth dimension represents time, allowing for the visualization of
evolving systems or dynamic surfaces.

GLgraph is an invaluable resource for students, educators, and researchers
in mathematics, physics, engineering, and other scientific disciplines
who need to understand and analyze multi-dimensional functions through
intuitive and high-quality graphical representations.
