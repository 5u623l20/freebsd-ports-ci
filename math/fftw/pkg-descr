FFTW (Fastest Fourier Transform in the West) is a highly optimized C
subroutine library for computing the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT).
It supports one or more dimensions, both real and complex data, and
arbitrary input size, making it a versatile tool for various applications.

FFTW is renowned for its exceptional performance, consistently outperforming
other publicly available FFT software across a wide range of platforms.
Its performance is also highly portable, ensuring optimal execution on
most architectures without requiring modifications.

Key features and benefits include:

-   **Versatile DFT Computation**: Handles 1D, 2D, and multi-dimensional
    DFTs for both real and complex datasets.
-   **Arbitrary Input Size**: Efficiently processes data of any length,
    without power-of-two restrictions.
-   **Self-Optimizing**: Employs adaptive algorithms that tune themselves
    to the underlying hardware for peak performance.

Developed at MIT by Matteo Frigo and Steven G. Johnson, FFTW has become
the de facto standard for FFT computations in scientific computing,
signal processing, image analysis, and many other fields where fast
and accurate Fourier transforms are critical.
