libbraiding is a C++ shared library that exposes the functionalities
of the Braiding program, a tool for computations within braid groups.
Braid groups are fundamental mathematical objects in topology and algebra,
used to describe the intertwining of strands.

This library provides a robust and efficient framework for performing
various computations on braid groups, including:

-   **Normal Forms**: Calculating canonical representations of braids,
    essential for comparison and analysis.
-   **Other Computations**: Facilitating a range of algebraic operations
    and manipulations within braid groups.

While initially conceived for integration as a component of SageMath,
a comprehensive open-source mathematics software system, libbraiding
is designed to be a standalone library. This allows any C++ program
to leverage its powerful capabilities for braid group computations.

libbraiding is an invaluable resource for mathematicians, computer
scientists, and researchers working in topology, group theory, and
related fields, offering a flexible and high-performance solution
for exploring the intricate world of braids.
